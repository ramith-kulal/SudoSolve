# SUDO SOLVE

A responsive Sudoku Solver web application built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to input Sudoku puzzles, validate them, and solve them using a backtracking algorithm. The project is deployed on Vercel: [Live Demo](https://sudosolve-six.vercel.app/).

## üöÄ Demo

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing
- **React** for interactive UI
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vercel** for deployment

## üß© Features
- **Input Sudoku Puzzle**: Users can input custom Sudoku puzzles using the interactive grid.
- **Clear Puzzle**: Reset the entire grid with a single click.
- **Check Validity**: Validate the current state of the puzzle.
- **Solve Puzzle**: Solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.

## üìú Approach

### 1. Validation Logic
The validation function checks if the current puzzle configuration follows the Sudoku rules:
- Each row must contain unique numbers (1-9).
- Each column must contain unique numbers (1-9).
- Each 3x3 subgrid must contain unique numbers (1-9).

If any duplicates are found in the row, column, or subgrid, the puzzle is marked as invalid.

### 2. Solving Algorithm
The Sudoku solver uses the **backtracking algorithm**:
- It finds the first empty cell (represented by `0`).
- It attempts to fill the cell with numbers from `1` to `9`.
- For each number, it checks if placing it in the current cell maintains the validity of the puzzle.
- If a valid number is found, it recursively attempts to solve the rest of the puzzle.
- If no valid number is found, it backtracks by resetting the cell to `0` and tries the next number.

This process continues until the entire puzzle is solved or deemed unsolvable.

### 3. Client-Side Rendering
The app uses client-side rendering with `useEffect` to handle navigation and state management. The `useRouter` hook from Next.js ensures smooth navigation back to the home page when the "Go Home" button is clicked.
